# Accelerator-Programs
Kelly Anderson

This project aims to create a model for predicting the frequency and position of a particle mapped through a 2D Henon Map for the purposes of calculating the dynamic aperature. More detail here: https://mediaspace.msu.edu/media/Machine+Learning+in+Accelerator+Physics/1_tnubgo8q

Running the notebook main.ipynb in the Accelerator-Programs folder will display the current results of the project. Other files are placeholders for turing the model into a package that can be installed.
