    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "One essential part of accerator physics is partacle tracking. It's used when designing components to make sure the beam travels down the line in the desired manner. There is a lot of software that provides particle tracking for different purposes, some for an designing an entire lattice others for inside a specific component. My research looks more at the mathematics at describes how the beam travels. There are complicated components that are nessesary to run an accelerator and many introduce nonlinear elements to particle motion. Looking at how these particles develope in phase space can help the design of new accelerators and give infomration about the equations that describe them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of my research is the analysis of the phase space of the particles in an accelerator. More specificaly looking for regions were orbits are stable and their frequencies as well as regions where motion is not stable and finding how quickly it decays. There are many different methods to do this analysis and this project hopes to start devoping machine learning as a useful tool for developing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will involve using machine learning to hopefully devope a model that will tell us more about the equations that describe the motion. It is difficult to obtain extensive data for particle motion. The way to get experimental data is by using the data from the beam position monitors that are placed periodicly in a lattice. To get a full picture though, one would want more data and at smaller intervals. One common way to generate particle tracking data is using software. This can be done in software like madx which is used in designing lattices. The goal will be to use real data from national labs as well as from software to train a program to analysize the phase space of a particular system without using tracking data."
